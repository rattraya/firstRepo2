# firstRepo

This is an example markdown document for our toy repository. Normally this part of the document would contain an abstract, summary or introduction to the material covered in the document. You may find [this cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) helpful for recreating this document.

This is a new paragraph with some text in *italics* and some text **bolded**. Here is a table with some of the basic data types in R.

|**Type**   |**Description** |
|:---------:|:---------------|
|`numeric()`  |real numbers |
|`integer()`  |integer numbers |
|`factor()`   |categorical data|
|`character()`|text data |
|`data.frame()`|a data set  |

Notice that the R code in the table above (e.g. `numeric()`) is formatted differently than the plain text in the description column. We could have done this as a list instead.

* numeric(): real numbers
* integer(): integer numbers
* factor(): categorical data
    * I don't usually like factors, but they do have their place. You'll almost always find character variables easier to work with.
* character(): text data
* data.frame(): a data set
    * Or you could use data_frame(). I like them better for reasons we will discuss later in the course.
    
    

**Subsection**
Here we have a subsection containing a block quote from [@BroadhurstDavid](https://twitter.com/BroadhurstDavid):
>Really Dr. McCoy You must learn to govern your passions; they will be your undoing. Logistic Regression suggests...
>You can also include a block of R code. Remember this code from last week?
```
while(TRUE)
{
Sys.time()
Sys.sleep(10)
}
```

Git won't do anything for us, unless we ask it to do so. Commit README.md to our firstRepo repository. You will need `git
add` and `git commit` when doing this locally. If you edit the file on GitHub, you can commit in one step. Other commands
that you may find useful at this stage include:
`git status``
`git log`
`git pull`

**Making changes**
A simple R script
Start by making a simple R script, script1.R that creates a pdf figure from a randomly generated cloud of points. Comment
your code to document what it is doing at each step.
```
library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
set.seed(297834) # pick your own seed
dat <‐ data_frame(pred = rnorm(100),
resp = pred + rnorm(100))
pdf('../out1.pdf')
ggplot(dat, aes(pred, resp)) +
geom_point()
dev.off()
```
Get some data

adding a line to see if I can push it.
now I am adding yet another line
